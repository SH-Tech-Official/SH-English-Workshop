📚 Day 2 – What I Learned

✔️ 1. Patient (adj.) vs Patience (noun)

Patient → صفت

Patience → اسم
در جمله‌ی من باید از patience استفاده شود:
success needs patience


✔️ 2. After “needs”, we usually use a noun or a gerund (verb + ing)

مثال درست:

success needs patience

success needs improving your goals


✔️ 3. The correct expression is “full of challenges”

برای بیان چالش‌بر بودن مسیر، انگلیسی‌زبان‌ها از عبارت طبیعی و حرفه‌ایِ:
full of challenges
استفاده می‌کنند.

✔️ 4. After modal verbs, the verb comes in the base form
