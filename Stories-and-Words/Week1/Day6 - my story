✅ Day 6 – Story & Insights


Story (Me)

The people of the world must know that today, a new girl was born in Iran.
Her name is Sahar. She is going to create a new world of Technology.
She was once a lost girl, but now she has created a purposeful person from herself.
She will face many challenges and problems because she has big goals.
Sahar is a smart and brave girl.
She just needs enough energy and a silent place to focus on studying and a few step-by-step plans.
Because she can do it, and I believe in her.

What I Learned

✔️ Verb after “face” → no “to”, we can use the object directly → face challenges.

✔️ Step-by-step → common expression for gradual plans.

✔️ Focus on → correct preposition with focus.

✔️ I believe in someone → common expression.

✔️ Has created → present perfect, to show action completed in the past affecting the present.
