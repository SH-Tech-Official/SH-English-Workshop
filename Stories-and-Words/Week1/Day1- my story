📘 Day 1 – Story

I'm a beginner learning English.
"I like an adventurous life very much because I want to discover surprising and strange things.
But sometimes I feel nervous, because strange things are not always good.
By the way, I am proud of my dreams, even if they are not perfect."

📚 Day 1 – What I Learned

✔️ 1. Adventurous life

I learned that when describing a type of life, we use an adjective like adventurous, not the noun adventure.

✔️ 2. Proud of…

I practiced the correct structure “proud of something”.

✔️ 3. Dreams that are not perfect

When talking about dreams or goals, English speakers naturally say “not perfect”.
