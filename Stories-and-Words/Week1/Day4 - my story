 What I Learned

✔️ After “need” → we can use a noun
Here, learning is a noun: “Every skill needs learning.”

✔️ Passive voice: “Skills are achieved” → skills are obtained by someone, not active voice.

✔️ Much effort: effort is an uncountable noun, so we use much instead of many.

✔️ Correct verb for mistakes: make mistakes, not do mistakes.

✔️ Encourage: we can motivate ourselves using “encourage yourself,” which is natural English.
